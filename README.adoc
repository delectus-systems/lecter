## Building and using

`make` or `make exe` to build `lecter`, a command-line tool for
reading and converting Delectus v1.x data files. Run `lecter` with no
argument for help using it.

`make lib` to build `libDelectus.a`. Use by statically linking to an application project.

`make dylib` to build `libDelectus.dylib`, the Delectus data engine as a dynamically-loadable library. Use by loading the library, calling initDelectus(), and then using the C functions declared in `include/Delectus.h`.

test-data contains several files in Delectus v 1.x and other formats
suitable for use with libDelectus and applications built with it.

`lisp/lecter` contains a small Common Lisp project that can exercise
libDelectus by loading the dylib and calling its APIs.
